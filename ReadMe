This project MAMAN14 "assembler" was made by:
Jenia Goldin(332429935) and Michael Tsirkin(316220681)
group 87 - Ram Tahor.

This project is an assembler designed to receive input and process it,
similar to any other programming language, with its own unique set of rules.

It was a great opportunity to learn and apply our knowledge to this project.


To run the program follow these instructions:

1:  in the terminal type "make" command , it will create all the object files (if it hasn't encountered a problem).
2:  in the terminal type  "./assembler <your file name> " it will run the program on the file (if the file exists in the folder with .as ending).
3:  if the file contains entry you will see .ent file.
4:  if the file contains extern you will see .ext file.
5:  if the file had any macros in it you will see them laid out in .am file.
6:  .ob file will hold all the data extracted from the file after it was translated to machine code
7:  the errors will be printed in the terminal.
